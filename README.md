# CMPT 120 in Fall 2024


This Repo is used to store public-facing examples and materials for CMPT 120, Fall 2024 with Nicholas Vincent.

Internal materials (e.g., assignments) are shared via Canvas.


- `genai_examples` includes examples of Python code produced using generative AI tools, that are meant to be useful for concepts. Reading and running through these code snippets should be very quick, and provides another chance to check your understanding so far.
- `notebooks` includes copies of the Jupyter notebooks that include all the code snippets from lecture slides.
