# CMPT 120 in Fall 2024


This Repo is used to store public-facing examples and materials for CMPT 120, Fall 2024 with Nicholas Vincent.

Internal materials (e.g., assignments) are shared via Canvas.


- `extra_practice_and_examples` includes markdown and Python files with additional example questions and examples of Python code produced using generative AI tools. Reading and running these code snippets should be very quick, and provides another chance to check your understanding so far.
- `notebooks` includes copies of the Jupyter notebooks that include all the code snippets from lecture slides.
