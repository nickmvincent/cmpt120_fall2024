- I will look closely at patterns in midterm answers to inform final exam prep materials

---
title: Python Functions with `def`
---

# Python Functions with `def`

- **`def`**: Used to define a function in Python

Syntax:

```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return True
```

Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
```

- Functions:
  - Encapsulate code for reuse
  - Can accept parameters
  - Can return values (or `None` if no return statement)

---

## Three more examples

Ex1:

```python
def foo1(a,b):
  return a+b
```

Ex2:

```python
def foo2(n):
  return n % 2 == 0
```

Ex3:

```python
def foo3(n):
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    result *= i
  return result
```

What do these do? What should we call them?

---

## Better names


Ex1:

```python
def add_two_nums(a,b):
  return a+b
```

Ex2:

```python
def is_even(n):
  return n % 2 == 0
```

Ex3:

```python
def factorial(n):
  result = 1
  for i in range(1, n + 1):
    result *= i
  return result
```

---
title: Python `while` Loop
---

# Python `while` Loop

- **`while` loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is `True`

Syntax:

```
while condition:
    # code block
```

Example:

```python
i = 0
while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

---
title: Why Use a `while` Loop?
---

# Why Use a `while` Loop (or not!)?

- **Good for: Flexible Condition**:
  - Use `while` when the number of iterations is unknown.
  - Example: Waiting for user input or external event.
  - When the loop condition is more complex than simple iteration (e.g., event-based, real-time updates).

**Example**:

```python
while not user_input:
    user_input = input("Enter something: ")
```
  
- **Watch out for:**:
  - Infinite Loops: Easier to create loops that run indefinitely until a condition is met.
  - Probably don't need while loops when you can define a specific range or collection to iterate over.

---
title: Python `continue`
---

# Python `continue`

- **`continue`**: Used inside a loop. Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.

- **Use Case**:
  - When you want to skip certain iterations based on a condition.
  
**Syntax**:

```
while condition:
    if some_check:
        continue
    # remaining code for other iterations
```

--- 

**Example**:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        continue
    print(i)
```
  
Output: `0, 1, 3, 4` (skips `2`)

- **Key Point**: 
  - Useful for skipping specific cases without stopping the loop.
  - Sometime if you "found what you're looking for" you can continue

---
title: More Practical Examples of `continue`
---

# More Practical Examples of `continue`

**Skip Even Numbers**:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
```
  
- Output: `1, 3, 5, 7, 9` (skips even numbers)

**Skip Blank Input**:

```python
inputs = ["hello", "", "world", "", "python"]
for item in inputs:
    if item == "":
        continue
    print(item)
```

Output: `hello, world, python` (skips empty strings)

- **Key Takeaway**:
  - `continue` helps ignore unwanted cases, allowing the loop to focus on relevant data.

---
title: Python `break`
---

# Python `break`

- **`break`**: Immediately exits the loop, stopping further iterations.

- **Use Case**:
  - When you need to stop the loop based on a condition.

- **Syntax**:
  ```
  while condition:
      if some_check:
          break
      # remaining code
  ```

**Example**:

```python
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
```

Output: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4` (loop stops at `i == 5`)

- **Key Point**:
  - `break` is useful when you want to exit a loop early based on a condition.

---
title: Practical Examples of `break`
---

# Practical Examples of `break`

**Stop on User Input**:

```python
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a number (or 'q' to quit): ")
    if user_input == 'q':
        break
    print(f"You entered: {user_input}")
```
  
- The loop stops when the user enters `q`.

**Find First Match in a List**:

```python
numbers = [3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print(f"First even number found: {num}")
        break
```

title: summary

# Summary of our control flow tools

- we already know `if`, `for`, and `range` really well
- now we know `def`, `while`, `continue`, and `break`
- These are our core control flow tools for CMPT 120
- If you think you'll write a lot of Python, consider just reading the offical docs now: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html
  - These are also useful if you just want to read the sections about if, for, range, def, while, continue, break

---

## Connecting back to bits and bytes

Let's put it all together and transition back to bits and bytes!

We'll work through a longer code example that uses `def`, `while`, `continue`, and `break`. 

Task: write a program that takes an 8-bit binary number from user and prints out the answer in decimal. Now, are program will continue to run until user enters 'exit' (while loop + break) and will ask the user to fix their input if it is invalid (continue).

---

## Step 1: Write a function to convert binary to decimal

```python
def binary_to_decimal(binary_str):
    """Convert a binary string to a decimal number."""
    decimal = 0
    for digit in binary_str:
        decimal = decimal * 2 + int(digit)
    return decimal
```

---


## Step 2: Write a function to convert decimal to ascii

(Turns out we can just use a Python built-in: effectively we're just giving it a new name)

```python
def decimal_to_ascii(decimal):
    """Convert a decimal number to its ASCII character."""
    return chr(decimal)
```

---

## Step 3: Use a while loop with break and continue

```python
def process_binary_input():
    """Process binary input and handle conversion to decimal and ASCII."""
    while True:
        binary_input = input("Enter an 8-bit binary number (or 'exit' to quit): ")
        
        if binary_input.lower() == 'exit':
            print("Exiting...")
            break
        
        # Ensure input is 8 bits and binary
        if len(binary_input) != 8 or not all(bit in '01' for bit in binary_input):
            print("Invalid input! Please enter an 8-bit binary number.")
            continue

        # Convert binary to decimal
        decimal_value = binary_to_decimal(binary_input)
        
        # Convert decimal to ASCII
        ascii_char = decimal_to_ascii(decimal_value)
        
        print(f"Binary: {binary_input} -> Decimal: {decimal_value} -> ASCII: {ascii_char}")

# Call the function to start the loop
process_binary_input()
```

  Converting Binary to Decimal
</div>

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  
  - **Binary Representation**:
    - Binary is a base-2 system (only `0` and `1`).
    - Each binary digit (bit) represents a power of 2.
    - Rightmost digit is 1.
    - Second from right is 2.
    - Third from right 4. And so on.

**Example**:

Binary: 1011
  
```python  
1 * 2^3 + 0 * 2^2 + 1 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0
# 11
```


</div>

<div class="text-center text-2xl mb-6">
  Step-by-Step Guide
</div>

- **Start from the rightmost bit**:
  - Assign powers of 2 (starting from 2^0).
  
- **Multiply each bit** by its corresponding power of 2.
  
- **Sum the results** to get the decimal number.

<div class="mt-4">
  - Binary: `1011`
  - Decimal: `11`

title: Hexadecimal
---

# Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal is a numbering system that's often used for RGB colors.

- Binary uses powers of 2, so we only need two characters (0 and 1)
- Decimal uses power of 10, so we need ten characters
- Hexadecimal uses power of 16...

But we only have 10 digits?

---

## Taking 6 extra characters from the alphabet

In hexadecimal, there are 16 digits (we use A - F for numbers 11-16).

- 0000 (binary) <> 0 (decimal) <> 0 (hexadecimal)
- 0001 (binary) <> 1 (decimal) <> 1 (hexadecimal)
- 0010 (binary) <> 2 (decimal) <> 2 (hexadecimal)

Ok, it's all the same until...

- 1010 (binary) <> 10 (decimal) <> A (hexadecimal)
- 1011 (binary) <> 11 (decimal) <> B (hexadecimal)
- 1100 (binary) <> 12 (decimal) <> C (hexadecimal)
- 1101 (binary) <> 13 (decimal) <> D (hexadecimal)
- 1110 (binary) <> 14 (decimal) <> E (hexadecimal)
- 1111 (binary) <> 15 (decimal) <> F (hexadecimal)

(TLDR: A = 10, B = 11, and so on)

---

# Example of hexadecimal

00FFAA is a green-blue color

00 means "0 red"

FF means "255 Green"

AA means "170 blue"

---

Why is FF 255?

FF -> 15 * (16 ** 1) + 15 (16 ** 0) = 225 + 16 = 240 + 15 = 255


---
title: Importance of Grouping
---

# Importance of Grouping

If you just know that 1 byte is 8 bits, that binary codes used powers of 2, and that and hexadecimal uses powers of 16 and the characters A-F, you can solve a lot of problems from "first principles".

However we also need to learn common practices around grouping:
- when storing text using an 8-bit character set like ASCII, bits are grouped into 8 bits so a string like "01001000 01101001" can be converted to two characters
- when storing colors as RGB hexadecimal strings, we only need 4 bits per character (only 16 possible characters)
- How many bytes for the string "AB"? 8 times 2 equals 16
- How many bytes for the color 00FFAA? 4 times 6 equals 24.

---

Some additional topics of interest: unicode, mojibake

--- 
title: Unicode
---

# About Unicode

- Unicode is a superset of ASCII. 
- A is a super of B means A includes B, but also other stuff.
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) defines 128 characters, including English letters, digits, and control characters, using 7 bits per character. 
- Unicode, on the other hand, was designed to encompass more characters from more writing systems worldwide, using up to 32 bits per character. The first 128 characters in Unicode are identical to ASCII, ensuring backward compatibility.

---

What happens if we have a text file encoded as Unicode, but we tell our computer it's ASCII?

Garbled text: called Mojibake!

For fun: see Wikipedia on this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake


---

One more example connecting back to our coding skills

```python
dec = ["65", "66", "67"]
chars = ["A", "B", "C"]
characters_as_dec = ["65", "65", "65", "67", "67", "67"]
for i in range(len(characters_as_dec)):
    for j in range(len(dec)):
        if characters_as_dec[i] == dec[j]:
            print(chars[j])
```

# Outcomes

What do we need to know here?

1. Knows what a bit represents in a computer
2. Convert a given number of bytes (or kb, mb) to bits
3. Convert binary <> decimal
4. Understand the goal of hexadecimal
5. Know that binary numbers convert to hexadecimal by grouping of 4 bits
6. Know the purpose of ASCII
7. Know relationship of Unicode to ASCII
8. Know how to store RGB numbers (3 byte aka 24 bits aka 6 hexadecimal digits)
