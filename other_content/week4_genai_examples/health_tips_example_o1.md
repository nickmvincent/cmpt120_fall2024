Please use advanced reasoning to create a pedagogically excellent example Python code script that captures all of the following concepts and learning goals. The point of this script is that students in an introductory programming course can read, and if they desire, reimplement, the full script as a way to check their understanding and progress.

Please include a consistent narrative in the code example. This should look like a semi-realistic piece of code with a real application.

for this version, please focus on making the example relevant and interesting to students in the Health Sciences.

The concepts are:
- pseudocode
- comments
- a header block with title/purpose, author, and date
- Python print
- python strings (single line, multiline, including a string variable)
- Python `input`
- variable assignment 
- string concatenation
- proper variable naming in python
- create list of strings
- use import to import random and use random.choice method
- know difference between functions and methods
- use if, elif, else
- use ==
- use boolean expression, including combinations and/or with and without parentheses
- can use string strip, lower and upper, including tricky cases of strip
- can use the `in` keyword for strings and lists
